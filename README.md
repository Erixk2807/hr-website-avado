# HR website for Avado

## About the project

I built this website in collaboration with another developer for the avado HR team. We prioritized accessibility and mobile responsiveness of the website. Most of the HTML structure and CSS styles were done by me, including mobile responsiveness of the website. 

We used webpack as our boilerplate and SASS to code CSS.
